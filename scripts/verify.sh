# forge verify — the conformance suite. Forge's test for Forge.
#
# `make validate` checks YAML frontmatter and `bash -n`. This checks CLAIMS:
# every flag this repo tells a machine to run, every config invariant it says
# holds, every substrate behaviour it depends on, and that the template it
# stamps actually comes up green.
#
# The rule this exists to enforce (ADR-0003, applied to ourselves for once):
#   A claim that cannot be asserted may not appear in a skill body,
#   because skill bodies are executed by machines that cannot tell
#   aspiration from observation.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/verify.sh                 # cli + config + substrate(free) + template
#   ./scripts/verify.sh cli config      # only these groups
#   ./scripts/verify.sh --with-codex    # also run the sandbox probes (spend tokens)
#   ./scripts/verify.sh --list          # list cases without running them
#
# Groups:
#   cli/        every long flag named beside a command in skills/, hermes/, docs/
#               must exist in that command's live --help                    (F5, F10)
#   config/     documented invariants, read PER PROFILE              (F3, F11, F13, F14)
#   substrate/  throwaway-lab probes of behaviour we depend on        (F2, F9, F15)
#   template/   stamp -> make setup -> hooks installed -> make check   (F8)
#   lane/       preconditions the unattended lane needs and cannot create for
#               itself. Every case was a real failure seen on 2026-07-28 while
#               driving `codex exec` by hand against a live chunk (rung 2).
#
# Exit 0 iff every case passes. Run it in CI, and as a hard gate after every
# `hermes update` and every codex/claude upgrade.
# =============================================================================
